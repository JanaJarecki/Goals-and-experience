    In phase 1 you will see two options like below. You choose an option by clicking on it, afterwards the result will appear in the box you just clicked.

            You will not see the probabilities of the options, which may be for example 5 points in 80 of 100 clicks and 7 points in 20 of 100 clicks, or some other probability. Your goal is to learn about the probabilities. You will have a maximum of {{ num_samples }} decisions to do so, however you can move on at any time.
            Once you feel like you understand the probabilities of the options you can continue to phase 2 by clicking on the “I am ready to move on” button.
            Above the options there will be a header that reads “Your threshold will be XX”. This informs you about the threshold you will have to reach or exceed in phase 2 (The threshold will be explained further on the next page).
