        You choose a option by clicking on it, afterwards a result will appear in the box you just clicked. This number is the points you would generate by choosing this option.
        In phase 1 your goal is to gain a sense of the probabilities of the options (the probabilities and options in one block are always the same). You will have a maximum of {{ num_samples }} decisions to gain a sense of the probabilities of the options, however you can move on at any time.
        Once you feel like you understand the probabilities of the options you can continue to phase 2 by clicking on the “I am ready to move on” button.
        Above the options there will be a header that reads “Your threshold will be XX”. This informs you about the threshold you will have to reach or exceed in phase 2 (The threshold will be explained further on the next page).
