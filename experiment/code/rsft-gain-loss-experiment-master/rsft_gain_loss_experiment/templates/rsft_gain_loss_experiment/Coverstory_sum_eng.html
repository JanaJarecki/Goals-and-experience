    The goal is to gain a sense of the probabilities of the options.
    You choose between two options.
    What matters is, that you <b>learn about the hidden probabilities in max {{ num_samples }} decisions.</b>

    <h3>{% blocktrans trimmed %}Phase 2{% endblocktrans %}</h3>
    {% blocktrans trimmed %}
    The goal is to collect points in order to reach or exceed a predefined threshold.
    You choose between two options, which increase your points.
    What matters is, that you <b>reach or exceed the threshold in {{ num_trials }} decisions.
    Remember that your points accumulate over the 5 decisions</b>
