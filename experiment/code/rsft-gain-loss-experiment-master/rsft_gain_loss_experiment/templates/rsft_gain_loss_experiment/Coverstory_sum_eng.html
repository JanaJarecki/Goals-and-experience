    The goal is to gain a sense of the probabilities of the options.
    You choose between two options.
    What matters is, that you <b>gain a sense of the probability and options in max {{ num_samples }} decisions.</b>
    Remember that you <b> do not </b> need to use all {{ num_samples }} decisions.

    <h3>{% blocktrans trimmed %}Phase 2{% endblocktrans %}</h3>
    {% blocktrans trimmed %}
    The goal is to collect points in order to reach or exceed a predefined threshold.
    You choose between two options, which increase your points.
    What matters is, that you <b>reach or exceed the threshold in {{ num_trials }} decisions.</b>
