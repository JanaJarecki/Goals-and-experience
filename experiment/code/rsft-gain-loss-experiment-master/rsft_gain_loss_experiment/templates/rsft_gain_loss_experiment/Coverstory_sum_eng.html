    The goal is to gain a sense of the outcomes of the options and their probabilities.
    You choose between two options, which <b> do not </b> increase your points.
    What matters is, that you <b>gain a sense of the outcomes of the options</b> in max {{ num_samples }} decisions.
    Remember that you <b> do not </b> need to use all {{ num_samples }} sample rounds.
